# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.  
It also includes a Streamlit-based web app where you can draw a digit and get real-time predictions.

---

## Features
- Predicts handwritten digits using CNN  
- Simple Streamlit GUI for drawing digits  
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras and MNIST dataset  
- Model trained and saved as `.h5` file  

---

## Files
- `handwritten_digit_recognition.py` → Trains the CNN model  
- `app.py` → Streamlit app for drawing and predicting digits  
- `handwritten_digit_model.h5` → Saved trained model

## How to Run

# 1. Train the Model (optional)
python handwritten_digit_recognition.py

# 2️. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3️. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
